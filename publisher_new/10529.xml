  <subfield code="a">High dropout rates and poor academic performance are frequent characteristics of the educational experience for African-American male youths (Bailey &amp;amp;amp; Paisley, 2004). With increased accountability standards to raise the academic achievement levels, single-sex educational environments have taken a central role in school reform agendas and initiatives in many school districts (Herr &amp;amp;amp; Arms, 2004). The incorporation of a single-sex grouping served as a conduit for teachers to deliver instruction based on the varied learning styles of the students. This study was designed to determine the effect single-sex classroom instruction has on African American malesâ€™ achievement in ninth-grade mathematics compared to that of the other student groups. The researcher investigated a public school in a North Texas school district that offered alternative educational options for the students. Single-sex classrooms were created in mathematics. Teachers taught single-sex classes of students from varied ethnic backgrounds during at least one double-blocked period each day. Ex post facto data were analyzed. An independent samples t-test and a two-way factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were utilized to test each hypothesis to determine whether significant differences existed in the scale scores of comparison groups on state-mandated assessments over a period of 3 years. The instrument used to measure academic achievement is the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills. This study found that the mathematics scores of African American males in single-sex classes did not significantly differ from the scores of African American males in coeducational classes. The scores for the males in single-sex classes were slightly higher than that of males in coeducational classes at each grade level throughout the 3-year period. The mathematics scores of African American females in single-sex learning environments were not significantly different than those of African American males in single-sex classes. The scores for the female students were consistently higher throughout the 3-year period. This study identified the need for single-sex instructional opportunities for students as a means of eliminating the achievement gap.</subfield>
