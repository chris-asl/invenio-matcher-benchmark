    <subfield code="a">Bipartite entanglement entropies, calculated from the reduced density matrix of a subsystem, provide a description of the resources available within a system for performing quantum information processing. However, these quantities are not uniquely defined on a system of non-Abelian anyons. This paper describes how reduced density matrices and bipartite entanglement entropies (such as the von Neumann and Renyi entropies) may be constructed for non-Abelian anyonic systems, in ways which reduce to the conventional definitions for systems with only local degrees of freedom.</subfield>

The linearisation of the fusion trees may be achieved on $D_1$ and $M_1$ from the projections given in \pfref{fig:totalcharge}(iii) and \pfref{fig:projection}(ii) respectively by rearranging the relevant anyons as shown. $\vec{A}_1$ and $\vec{A}_2$ label the vectors describing the translations applied to anyon $a_2$ in each case. The net difference in the trajectory of $a_2$ may then be described by vector $\vec{A}_1-\vec{A}_2$, which braids $a_2$ behind $a_3$. (iii)~Consequently, an operator $\hat{O}_{D_1}$ having the form of \pfref{fig:totalcharge}(iii) in $\mc{O}^\prime_{D_1}$ has a representation in $\mc{O}_{M_1}$ as shown [with projection as per \pfref{fig:projection}(ii)]. The coefficients in this expression are the same as in \pfref{fig:totalcharge}(iii), and the mapping between $\mc{O}'_{D_1}$ and $\mc{O}_{M_1}$ is described by the operator $\hat{B}$. (iv)~Given a density matrix of the form given in \fref{fig:operatorM}, these diagrams may be concatenated and traced as shown to compute the expectation value of $\hat{O}_{D_1}$. (v)~Construction of a reduced density operator $\hat\rho_{D_1}\!\in\mc{O}^\ostar_{D_1}$ satisfying $\mrm{qTr}(\hat{\rho}_{D_1}\,\hat{O}_{D_1})=\mrm{qTr}(\hat\rho~\hat{O}_{D_1})~\forall~\hat{O}_{D_1}\!\in\mc{O}^\ostar_{D_1}$, where qTr denotes the quantum trace.

    <subfield code="y">00000 When constructing a fusion tree basis on a system of non-Abelian anyons, in order to unambiguously describe the state of a physical system it is necessary to specify the relevant pairs-of-pants decomposition. For example, when the fusion tree in diagram~(i) is taken in conjunction with the pairs-of-pants decomposition indicated by shading in diagram~(ii), this suffices to specify a state $|\psi_1\ra$ on manifold $M_1$ (which is a disc with trivial total charge). If the same sum over weighted fusion trees~(i) is instead associated with the decomposition of $M_1$ given in diagram~(iii), then this specifies a different a different state $|\psi_2\ra$, where $|\psi_2\ra=\hat B_{234}|\psi_1\ra$ for $\hat B_{234}$ given in diagram~(iv). In diagrams~(ii) and~(iii), the dashed line represents the projection of the fusion tree onto the manifold when viewed from above, following its initial construction from the pairs-of-pants decomposition but prior to its flattening onto the page in the form of diagram~(i). Vertex indices have been suppressed throughout this paper for simplicity, but may easily be reintroduced if required.</subfield>

    <subfield code="y">00006 (i)~Fusion tree basis for a chain of six Ising anyons on the disc with trivial boundary charge. Note the ordering of anyons on the fusion tree. Fusion products $a_1$ and $a_2$ may either be the fermion charge $\psi$ or the trivial charge $\mbb{I}$. (ii)~Braiding operator $\hat{B}_{34}$ affecting entanglement between regions $A$ and $B$. Under the action of this braid, basis elements satisfying $a_1=a_2$ acquire a phase of $\mrm{e}^{-\pi\rmi/4}$ whereas those satisfying $a_1\not=a_2$ acquire a phase of $\mrm{e}^{3\pi\rmi/4}$. This transformation is inherently nonlocal, belonging to neither $\mc{O}'_A$ nor $\mc{O}'_B$, and so is capable of generating entanglement between regions $A$ and $B$. (iii)~Alternative projection of the fusion tree of diagram~(i) onto the disc, differing from that of diagram~(i) precisely by the braiding operator of diagram~(ii). Note that a density matrix in this basis does not admit the construction of a reduced density matrix on region $A$ or region $B$ without first applying an appropriate braiding operator. For example, applying $(\hat{B}_{34})^{-1}$ to diagram~(iii) permits construction of $\rhoAM$ or $\rhoBM$ by recovering the basis of diagram~(i). It is, however, compatible with the construction of a reduced density matrix for region $C$ or region $D$ as shown in diagram~(iv).</subfield>

    <subfield code="y">00005 Construction of a reduced density matrix for a more complicated system of anyons, using the diagrammatic formalism for surfaces of higher genus given in \prcite{pfeifer2012a}. (i)~Manifold $M$ with three handles and four anyons, divided into submanifolds $A$ and $B$. (ii)~Choice of fusion tree basis $F_A$ for operators on region $A$, with projection onto $A$. (iii)~Choice of fusion tree basis $F'_A$ for operators on region $A$, with projection onto $A$. (iv)~Compatible choice of basis $F_{M'}$ on $M^\ostar$, with projection onto $M'$. On surfaces of nonzero genus, an appropriately chosen projection of the fusion tree may still unambiguously specify the pairs-of-pants decomposition of the manifold when taken in conjunction with the corresponding fusion tree. (v)~Corresponding fusion tree basis $F_M$ on $M$, with projection. (vi)~Diagram for calculation of $\hat\rho_A$ from a density operator $\hat{\rho}$ expressed in the basis of diagram~(iv). Sums, labels, and coefficients have been suppressed for clarity. On simplification this reduces to an operator having the form given in diagram~(iii), written in basis $F'_A$ and acting on anyons $a_2$ and $a_3$ but not on the boundary charges of $A$. In the fusion tree portions of diagrams~(iv)-(vi) the symbols $*$, $\diamond$, and $\triangleleft$ represent identifications in the plane, whereas in the manifold portions of the diagram they indicate the handles which correspond to these identifications, relating the fusion tree to the manifold and fixing the orientation of topological charges such as $a_{10}$. In diagram~(vi) it is unimportant whether traces are performed behind or in front of the identification labelled $*$ so long as this choice is made consistently. Diagrammatic isotopy may be used to move these traces to the right if preferred.</subfield>

    <subfield code="y">00003 (i)~Fusion tree basis for states of four anyons on manifold $M_1$ with a possible boundary charge $a_\mrm{b}$. If $a_\mrm{b}$ is trivial, the corresponding leaf may be deleted from the fusion tree to recover the basis of \fref{fig:projection}(i). Note that the projection of the fusion tree now extends to the boundary of $M_1$. (ii)~General form of an operator acting on a 3-anyon disc $D_1$ with boundary charge. Label $a_{D_1}$ represents the charge on the boundary of $D_1$. (iii)~General form of an operator on $D_1$ which leaves the boundary charge invariant. The total boundary charge is denoted $a_\mrm{t}$, and in this example corresponds to $\overline{a_{D_1}}$ for the value of $a_{D_1}$ given in diagram~(ii), because the boundary is non-disjoint. Note that the projection of this fusion tree no longer extends to the boundary as the total boundary charge is not associated with a leaf of the fusion tree.</subfield>

Surfaces of higher genus Generalisation of this approach to manifolds M and submanifolds A of arbitrary genus permits the construction of a reduced density matrix ˆρA for any manifold M and submanifold A ⊂ M.

Let C be the set of charges associated with boundaries on A which are not also boundaries on M (i.e. boundaries which would be created on cutting around A).
