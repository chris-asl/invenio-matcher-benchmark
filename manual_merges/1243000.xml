    <subfield code="m">[3]. The beam direction is set in the simulations according to the incident angle corresponding to each test case. The geometry configuration reproducing the experimental set-up for the determination of the longitudinal energy deposition is the same as described in [15]. For the simulation of the total deposited energy, the geometry configuration consists of a single sensitive volume, corresponding to the calorimeter in the experimental set-up. The two configurations are sketched in Fig. 1 and 2 respectively. The physics interactions that can be configured in the simulation are: ionization, Bremsstrahlung and multiple scattering for electrons, Rayleigh and Compton scattering, photoionization and conversion for photons. With the exception of multiple scattering, the physics configuration of the simulation is identified in the following as The simulations are configured with three alternative electron-photon settings: those based on the EEDL and EPDL evaluated data libraries (also known as the library), those reengineered from the Penelope Monte Carlo code and those implemented in the Geant4 electromagnetic package. γ conversion is not relevant at the energies considered in this study. Functionality for the simulation of Rayleigh scattering is available in Geant4, based on EPDL and reengineered from Penelope, for all versions considered in this paper, and is activated in the simulations produced</subfield>

    <subfield code="a">Geant4-based simulations of the energy deposited by electrons in various materials are quantitatively compared to high precision calorimetric measurements taken at Sandia Laboratories. The experimental data concern electron beams of energy between a few tens of keV and 1 MeV at various incidence angles. Two experimental scenarios are evaluated: the longitudinal energy deposition pattern in a finely segmented detector, and the total energy deposited in a larger size calorimeter. The simulations are produced with Geant4 versions from 9.1 to 9.6; they involve models of electron-photon interactions in the standard and low energy electromagnetic packages, and various implementations of electron multiple scattering. Significant differences in compatibility with experimental data are observed in the longitudinal energy deposition patterns produced by the examined Geant4 versions, while the total deposited energy exhibits smaller variations across the various Geant4 versions, with the exception Geant4 9.4. The validation analysis, based on statistical methods, shows that the best compatibility between simulation and experimental energy deposition profiles is achieved using electromagnetic models based on the EEDL and EPDL evaluated data libraries with Geant4 9.1. The results document the accuracy achievable in the simulation of the energy deposited by low energy electrons with Geant4; they provide guidance for application in similar experimental scenarios and for improving Geant4.</subfield>
