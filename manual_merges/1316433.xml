    <subfield code="a">Report of the Fermilab ILC Citizens' Task Force</subfield>
  </datafield>

    <subfield code="a">Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory convened the ILC Citizens' Task Force to provide guidance and advice to the laboratory to ensure that community concerns and ideas are included in all public aspects of planning and design for a proposed future accelerator, the International Linear Collider. In this report, the members of the Task Force describe the process they used to gather and analyze information on all aspects of the proposed accelerator and its potential location at Fermilab in northern Illinois. They present the conclusions and recommendations they reached as a result of the learning process and their subsequent discussions and deliberations. While the Task Force was charged to provide guidance on the ILC, it became clear during the process that the high cost of the proposed accelerator made a near-term start for the project at Fermilab unlikely. Nevertheless, based on a year of extensive learning and dialogue, the Task Force developed a series of recommendations for Fermilab to consider as the laboratory develops all successor projects to the Tevatron. The Task Force recognizes that bringing a next-generation particle physics project to Fermilab will require both a large international effort and the support of the local community. While the Task Force developed its recommendations in response to the parameters of a future ILC, the principles they set forth apply directly to any large project that may be conceived at Fermilab-or at other laboratories-in the future. With this report, the Task Force fulfills its task of guiding Fermilab from the perspective of the local community on how to move forward with a large-scale project while building positive relationships with surrounding communities. The report summarizes the benefits, concerns and potential impacts of bringing a large-scale scientific project to northern Illinois. The Fermilab ILC Citizens Task Force resulted from the recommendations of an earlier citizens' group, the Fermilab Task Force on Public Participation. That first task force recommended that Fermilab convene a new dedicated Task Force as soon as the ILC became a real prospect for Fermilab but before key decisions were made, so that local citizens could weigh in on issues that would affect the community. In late summer of 2006, Fermilab put out a call for nominations to the ILC Citizens' Task Force. Of the nearly 100 nominations received, 25 finalists were selected to serve. Ultimately, 26 members saw the process through to the end and participated in the development of this report. Meeting once a month from January 2007 through April 2008, the Task Force conducted extensive study and discussion of the ILC and related topics. Members took site tours, heard presentations from a wide range of experts from Fermilab and other organizations, and engaged in dialogues and exercises to explore topics in detail. Besides its specific recommendations, the Task Force acknowledges three broad realizations that emerged from the process and that served as a point of departure in writing the report. The Value of Fermilab The research conducted at Fermilab and the people who work at the laboratory make significant contributions to the advancement of scientific discovery, technological innovation and the regional economy. Given its role in developing technological and human resources within northern Illinois, Fermilab is a resource to be valued, whether or not the laboratory ultimately hosts the ILC. Reinvestment in Fermilab's future a matter of local and national concern. The Value of High Energy Physics to the U.S. Hosting a next-generation accelerator at Fermilab would strengthen continued scientific leadership by the United States and build on Fermilab's central role in Report of the Fermilab ILC Citizens' Task Force 1 the international physics community and the nation's commitment to research in basic science. The Value of U.S. Investment in Basic Science Although it is not for this Task Force to offer judgments as to which scientific endeavors should have priority over others in the nation's decision-making, the Task Force recognizes a value in the nation making the kind of long-term investment in research and eventual application of research that projects like the ILC represent. While the Task Force supports each of these conclusions, they should not be interpreted as support for building a project such as the ILC at Fermilab regardless of cost, impact and configuration. Any large project built at Fermilab, and particularly one extending beyond the current physical borders of the site, must be planned and built with care, caution and sincere consideration of community concerns. The report outlines a wide range of potential community concerns and makes detailed recommendations on issues of construction, environment, health and safety, economics, political considerations and community engagement. Key recommendations include: • Develop a sound rationale and justification for bringing a next-generation particle accelerator to Fermilab that is primarily based on the science and other benefits to the entire nation, rather than on the local economic benefits generated by the distribution of tax dollars. • Look for ways to locate offsite surface facilities so that they have the least impact on the community and potentially bring some benefit. • Do everything possible to make land transfers and easements fair, equitable and voluntary. • Potentially hazardous or disturbing activities such as rock removal, radioactive materials management, or major transportation activities should be centered on the Fermilab site. to the extent possible, rather than at off-site facilities. • Discuss in detail, and as early in the process as possible, the levels and types of radiation that will be produced, how they will be managed and the relevant risks. • Recognize that community priorities do not always match technical priorities and some things may need to be reordered to ensure public understanding and input on key issues. • Adopt the goal of no permanent impact on water quality and quantity, wildlife habitat and other natural resources, at the end of the project. • Incorporate "green" practices whenever possible. • Learn from the past, particularly from the SSC experience, and apply the lessons learned. • Prepare a detailed analysis and understanding of the economic impact of the United States hosting the next-generation accelerator vs. participating in an offshore accelerator. • Local government entities should have high priority for early and ongoing communications regarding requirements, plans and impacts. • Design with the end in mind to make decommissioning efficient and minimize community impacts. And most important: • Inform and engage the community at every step of the process and use community input to minimize negative impacts and maximize benefits of any large-scale scientific project.</subfield>
