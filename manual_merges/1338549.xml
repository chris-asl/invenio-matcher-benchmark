    <subfield code="a">The spins of a number of supermassive and stellar-mass black holes have been measured based on detections of thermal continuum emission and relativistically broadened iron lines in their x-ray spectra. Likewise, quasiperiodic variability has been observed in several sources. Such measurements commonly make the assumption that black holes are described by the Kerr metric, which according to the no-hair theorem characterizes black holes uniquely in terms of their masses and spins. This fundamental property of black holes can be tested observationally by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric introduced by a parametrically deformed Kerr-like spacetime. Thermal spectra, iron lines, and variability have already been studied extensively in several such metrics, which usually depend on only one particular type of deviation or contain unphysical regions outside of the compact object. In this paper, I study these x-ray probes in the background of a new Kerr-like metric which depends on four independent deviation functions and is free of pathological regions outside of the event horizon. I show that the observed signals depend significantly on primarily two types of deviations and that the strong correlation between the spin and the deviation parameters found previously in other Kerr-like metrics is partially broken for rapidly spinning black holes. This suggests that high-spin sources are the best candidates for tests of the no-hair theorem with x-rays and I obtain first constraints on such deviations from the stellar-mass black hole Cygnus X-1.</subfield>

    <subfield code="y">00021 Contours of constant $g$-mode frequency for a $10M_\odot$ black hole as a function of the spin and the deviation parameters $\alpha_{13}$ (left) and $\alpha_{22}$ (right). In the top panel, frequency contours are shown as solid blue curves with frequencies (top to bottom) $50~{\rm Hz}$, $100~{\rm Hz}$, $200~{\rm Hz}$, $300~{\rm Hz}$, $400~{\rm Hz}$, $500~{\rm Hz}$, $600~{\rm Hz}$, and $700~{\rm Hz}$. For reference, contours of constant ISCO radius are shown as dotted magenta lines with radii (top to bottom) $8M$, $7M$, $\ldots$, $2M$. In the gray dotted region, the radial epicyclic frequency does not vanish at the ISCO and $g$-modes may not exist. In the bottom panel, frequency contours are shown as solid blue curves with frequencies (left to right) $75~{\rm Hz}$, $100~{\rm Hz}$, $200~{\rm Hz}$, $300~{\rm Hz}$, $400~{\rm Hz}$, $500~{\rm Hz}$, and $600~{\rm Hz}$. Contours of constant ISCO radius are shown as dotted magenta lines with radii (left to right) $6M$, $5M$, $\ldots$, $2M$. In both cases, the contours of constant $g$-mode frequency are mostly aligned with the contours of constant ISCO radius except for larger deviations from the Kerr metric if the ISCO lies at a radius smaller than roughly $3M$. The black shaded region marks the excluded part of the parameter space.</subfield>

In the top panel, frequency contours are shown as solid blue curves with frequencies (top to bottom) $100~{\rm Hz}$, $150~{\rm Hz}$, $250~{\rm Hz}$, $450~{\rm Hz}$, $600~{\rm Hz}$, and $900~{\rm Hz}$. In the gray dotted region, the radial epicyclic frequency does not vanish at the ISCO and resonance modes may not exist. The additional blue line at the bottom forms the disjoint second branch of the $250~{\rm Hz}$ contour which emerges at the boundary of the gray dotted region at a value of the spin $a\approx-0.2M$ (not shown). For reference, contours of constant ISCO radius are shown as dotted magenta lines with radii (top to bottom) $8M$, $7M$, $\ldots$, $2M$. In the bottom panel, frequency contours are shown as solid blue curves with frequencies (left to right) $200~{\rm Hz}$, $300~{\rm Hz}$, $500~{\rm Hz}$, $1000~{\rm Hz}$, and $1500~{\rm Hz}$.

Both panels show the observed number flux density at $1~{\rm keV}$ in units of ${\rm keV^{-1}~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$. The highest emission originates from a strongly localized region near the ISCO on the side of the black hole that is approaching the observer where Doppler boosting and beaming are particularly high. This region shifts toward the black hole and emits a significantly higher flux for negative values of the parameter $\alpha_{13}$.</subfield>
