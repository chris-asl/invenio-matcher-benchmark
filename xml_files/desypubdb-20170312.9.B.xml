  <subfield code="a">2015 – the UNESCO “International Year of Light” – was ahighly dynamic year for DESY, and many areas of the researchcentre were buzzing with activity. Ongoing projects, extensiveconstruction work for new facilities and significant planningwork towards new projects kept us busy. At the same time,DESY engaged in new national and international researchcollaborations and developed a location of excellenceconcept for both the Hamburg and the Zeuthen campus.In the field of photon science, the construction of theEuropean XFEL X-ray free-electron laser – currently DESY’slargest project – is in full swing. More than two thirds of therequired 100 superconducting accelerator modules havealready been manufactured and installed in the tunnel (Fig. 1).Our plan is to inject the first electron beam into the linearaccelerator before the end of 2016. Two other major DESYprojects, the expansion of the PETRA III synchrotron radiationsource and the FLASH soft X-ray free-electron laser, areprogressing similarly well. In 2015, the outer facades of thetwo PETRA III extension halls were completed, and thetechnical equipment is now being put into place.The FLASH2 experimental hall was also completed (Fig. 2),and commissioning of the experimental setups started.In particle and astroparticle physics, DESY scientists werenot idle either, as this brochure attests to, and the secondNobel Prize awarded to this field in three years (in 2013 forthe Higgs mechanism and in 2015 for the discovery ofneutrino oscillations) clearly provided a significant boost inmotivation and morale.Figure 2The astroparticle physics community was particularlyinvolved in the preparations for the next large facility, theCherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) gamma-ray observatory.In 2015, negotiations about the two intended sites on thenorthern and southern hemisphere started, and the DESYsite in Zeuthen will soon apply to host the CTA headquarters,the location of which will be decided in 2016.After a two-year upgrade, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) atCERN near Geneva in Switzerland started up again in 2015.Scientists all around the world are now eagerly waiting fornew discoveries from the collider, which was operated closeto its design energy. At the same time, DESY is preparing forthe high-luminosity upgrade of the facility, due to start in2022. The research centre will host the national detectorassembly facility for the tracking detector end-caps of theupgraded ATLAS and CMS experiments.All these activities take place in extensive internationalcooperation. At DESY, we take pride in our open-mindednessand in the great national and cultural diversity of our staff,which currently includes colleagues from more than60 nations. Curiosity and passion for research clearly buildbridges between people – here at DESY, we demonstrate,every day, that integration works! Lately, we have witnessed an unprecedented immigration ofrefugees, many of whom now live in shelters or camps veryclose to the DESY campus. As a publicly funded researchcentre, DESY cannot grant direct financial support or reduceits employees’ working hours to compensate for voluntarywork with refugees. However, DESY can, to a certain extent,grant access to its infrastructures and facilities, and we aretrying our best to do so. I would like to use this opportunityto thank all those who, in their often limited spare time, havestarted a wide range of activities and efforts to make therefugees feel welcome and to relieve their distress.I am aware that our many and diverse activities and projectsare a challenge for all staff members at DESY – a challengethat, I am proud to say, we handle admirably. I cannot extenda big enough “thank you” to fully express the appreciation Ihave for the excellent work and continued commitment of ourstaff members and external collaborators. I am very muchlooking forward to their results in 2016!</subfield>
